Exercise 11 

Download the C# project BankVersion1 from the class website.
This exercise is about defining a new class yourself! In the project, there is a file called BankAccount.cs, containing a definition of a class BankAccount. However, the definition is empty…

We have to fill out the class definition. The requirements to the bank account class are the following:
 It must have a name, which is the name of the account holder
 It must have a balance, which is a decimal number.
 It must have a method Deposit, which you can use for depositing an amount to the account (that is, the balance should increase)
 It must have a method Withdraw, which you can use for withdrawing an amount from the account (that is, the balance should decrease)
 It must have methods for returning the value of the account holder name, and the value of the balance (one method for each value)

Given these requirement, your tasks are:
1. Fill out the BankAccount definition, such that all requirements are fulfilled. This includes definition of instance fields, constructors and methods
2. Make some test code that tests your BankAccount class. That is, you should create a BankAccount object, call the withdraw/deposit methods, and use the available methods to check that the object behaves as expected with regards to the value of the balance
3. If you have time left, try to extend the class definition with methods for adding interest to the account. It is up to you to define requirements, etc..
NOTE: This is a fairly large and somewhat difficult exercise. Try to solve it in small steps – get a little bit to work, test it, and then proceed to the next little bit. Manage the complexity!
